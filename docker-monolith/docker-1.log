Having run the Docker commands "docker inspect <container_id>" and "docker inspect <image_id>"
one can conclude that Docker image serves as a read-only template for Docker container.
The Docker container adds a read-write layer on top of the static immutable image layers.

In terms of object-oriented programming paradygm, Docker images are essentially classes and
Docker containers are instances of the classes.
